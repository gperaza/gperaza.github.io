abstract: Gravitational billiards composed of a viscoelastic frictional disk bouncing
  on a vibrating wedge have been studied previously, but only from the point of view
  of their translational behavior. In this work, the average rotational velocity of
  the disk is studied under various circumstances. First, an experimental realization
  is briefly presented, which shows sustained rotation when the wedge is tilted. Next,
  this phenomenon is scrutinized in close detail using a precise numerical implementation
  of frictional forces. We show that the bouncing disk acquires a spontaneous rotational
  velocity whenever the wedge angle is not bisected by the direction of gravity. Our
  molecular dynamics (MD) results are well reproduced by event-driven (ED) simulations.
  When the wedge aperture angle θ_W > π/2, the average tangential
  velocity
  of the disk scales with the typical wedge vibration velocity ,
  and is in general a nonmonotonic function of the overall tilt angle of the wedge.
  The present work focuses on wedges with θ_W=2π/3θ, which are relevant for
  the problem of spontaneous rotation in vibrated disk packings.
