abstract: It is shown that vibrated packings of frictional disks self-organize cooperatively
  onto a rotational-transport state where the long-time angular velocity ¯$ømega$i
  of each disk i is nonzero. Steady rotation is mediated by the spontaneous breaking
  of local reflection symmetry, arising when the cages in which disks are constrained
  by their neighbors acquire quenched disorder at large packing densities. Experiments
  and numerical simulation of this unexpected phenomenon show excellent agreement
  with each other, revealing two rotational phases as a function of excitation intensity,
  respectively, the low-drive (LDR) and the moderate-drive (MDR) regimes. In the LDR,
  interdisk contacts are persistent and rotation happens due to frictional sliding.
  In the MDR, disks bounce against each other, still forming a solid phase. In the
  LDR, simple energy-dissipation arguments are provided, that support the observed
  dependence of the typical rotational velocity on excitation strength.
