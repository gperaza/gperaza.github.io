abstract: A single frictional elastic disk, supported against gravity by two others,
  rotates steadily when the supports are vibrated and the system is tilted with respect
  to gravity. Rotation is here studied using molecular dynamics simulations, and a
  detailed analysis of the dynamics of the system is made. The origin of the observed
  rotational ratcheting is discussed by considering simplified situations analytically.
  This shows that the sense of rotation is not fixed by the tilt but depends on the
  details of the excitation as well.
