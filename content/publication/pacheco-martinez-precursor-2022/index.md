abstract: Kinetic energy is transferred through collisions to the millimeter particles
  that are in contact with the base of a vertically vibrated 3D container. In the
  early stages of a vibrational annealing process where the dimensionless acceleration
  is kept constant, the spontaneous appearance and disappearance of unstable clusters
  of ordered particles near the bottom surface of the container is observed. In later
  stages of this vibrational annealing process, the precursor nuclei stabilize becoming
  stable crystal seeds which resembles a thermal phase transition. Molecular Dynamics
  simulations based on these experimental observations are used to study the unstable–
  stable transition. The Ornstein– Zernike equation using the Percus– Yevick closure
  is applied to the stages before and after the observation of the stable crystal
  seeds in order to extract the effective potentials associated with the phase transition.
  Both the radial distribution function and the effective potentials show a clear
  correspondence of the spatial correlation as the crystallization phase begins to
  appear.
